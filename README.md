Project Overview

Project Purpose:
The goal of this project is to create an e-commerce product listing screen that displays products fetched from an API. The screen will handle the following tasks:

Displaying a list of products with their details (e.g., image, title, price, description, ratings).
Implementing loading and error states to ensure a smooth user experience.
Using Shimmer effects as placeholders for loading images and text.
Handling API errors and allowing the user to retry fetching data if needed.
Ensuring that the UI is responsive and scrollable, especially when the content exceeds the screen height.
